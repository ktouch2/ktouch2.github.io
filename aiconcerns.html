<p> While there may be great potential and development for AI, it doesn't mean that it doesn't come with it's own concerns.
</p>
<br>
          
	<li><strong> Technological Singularity:</strong> Technology could grow uncontrollably and create changes in our society and civilization.
    Even though developers are working hard towards developing 'strong AI' and 'superintelligence,' they are still only ideas that have not been created yet.
    There is the question of who will take responsibility if the AI does something wrong or makes a mistake.</li>
	<li><strong>AI Impact on Jobs:</strong> AI can change which jobs are needed for the future, eliminating those that aren't.
    New jobs that are dedicated to managing and improving AI systems could be created in the IT industry, where workers will need help in their transition.</li>
	<li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Data privacy protection, and security are a major concern. 
    There needs to be more laws like GDPR (EU) and CCPA (California) that give people more control over their own data. 
    To help this, companies have been investing more into the field of cybersecurity</li>
  <li><strong>Bias and Discrimination:</strong> AI systems can unintentionally cause bias and discrimination.
    Bias affects many areas in society, such as hiring and the medical industry. 
    To help counter this, companies are trying to limit their use of technology that could violate rights.</li>
  <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> Currently, there are no global AI regulations yet, but local laws and ethical guidelines are being developed on a smaller scale.
    The current ethical frameworks for AI do help, but they aren't legally binding. 
    There is a shared responsibility when using AI and that could make identifying and preventing harm difficult.</li>
