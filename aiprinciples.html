<p> While rules and protocols are being developed to manage the growing use of AI, academic communities created a set of princinples and guidelines that they should adhere by when using it in their experimental research and algorithmic development.
</p>
	<li><strong> Respect for Persons:</strong>strong> Recognizes people's right to make their own choices as well as protect those with who have implications that could hinder them from a decision (due to illness, disability, age, etc).
		Focus on informed consent where people must know the risks and benefits and decide if they wish to join/continue or leave the experiment anytime.</li>
	<li><strong>Beneficence:</strong> Researchers can not cause any harm to others with malicious intent.
		For the AI, this means the being careful so that algorithms don't unintentionally cause harm, for example reinforcing biases or give incorrect  information.</li>
	<li><strong>Justice:</strong>strong> Needs to be a focus that is fair and provides equal treatment.
		Burdens and benefits of research should be shared fairly, based on equal share, individual needs, individual efforts, social contribution, and merit.</li>
