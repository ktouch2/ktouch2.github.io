<p> Hello, welcome my website page where I will talk about the ethics of artificial intelligence. Artifical intelligence (AI) refers to technology or manchines, typically computer systems, that are able to perform taks that normally would require human intelligence or thought. 
	The AI systems learn how to complete there task by processing large amounts of data and looking for patterns to model in their own decision-making. 
	Once they are able to 'trained,' they are able to be utilized in many different fields, where they can be used to complete tasks or be supervised completeing the task by themselves. 
	With the continue use of AI, humans are able to make observations and input improvements into it to help further develop its efficiency and usage.
	This means that AI can continue be developed and perform even more complex tasks, such as image recognition and data analysis, in the future.
